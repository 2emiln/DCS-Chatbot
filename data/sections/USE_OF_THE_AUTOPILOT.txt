USE OF THE AUTOPILOT 
The autopilot is engaged by depressing the “PA” pushbutton while holding the autopilot disconnect trigger 
depressed on the control stick grip.  
The autopilot connects initially in basic functions (attitude hold) and PA illuminates. 
The autopilot modes are: 
 
Altitude Hold Mode (ALT) 
 
Heading Hold Mode (CAP) 
 
Localizer Mode (R) 
 
Glide Slope Mode (G) 
They are connected by pressing the corresponding pushbutton ALT (altitude), CAP (heading), R (runway) 
or G (glide slope). 
When passing through the transonic range the autopilot reverts to basic functions. 
Pressing the autopilot disengage lever or the PA pushbutton disengages the autopilot. 
Pressing the autopilot disconnect trigger the autopilot reverts to basic functions.
