PATTERNS 
In straight flight, an aircraft always stalls at the same incidence (angle of attack, AoA), regardless of the 
weight, while the stall speed depends on the weight. 
During approach, set the aircraft in landing configuration, allow the incidence to increase up to 10° and 
note the corresponding speed. In the final turn, adjust power to keep that speed. Use the incidence 
indicator as a reference (12° - 13°, green light on).
